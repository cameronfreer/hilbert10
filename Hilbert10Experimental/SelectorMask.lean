# Selector packing: global identities read blockwise

The packing algebra the selector encoding is built on, and the answer to the question #49 was
opened to decide. `Aggregation` is a bounded conjunction over block indices, bundled with a guard
mask and a program-length bound; the question was whether it can instead be expressed by finitely
many global identities. It can, and the lemmas here are why.

Originally a time-boxed probe under `Spike/`. It moved out when the general theorem came to
depend on it: `SelectorRegs`, `SelectorRegsGlobal` and `SelectorRegsDioph` are the load-bearing
chain, while the fixed-program and one-register developments stay under `Spike/` as the evidence
that decided the route.

## The distinction that decides it

A condition on a packed number is acceptable if the equivalence

> global identity between numbers  ⟺  the same identity in every block

is a **theorem proved by induction on the block index**, and unacceptable if it is a
*Diophantine condition* that itself needs representing. The circularity trap in
`Spike/Sequences.lean` is the second kind: coding partial products and requiring
`p (i + 1) = p i * h i` reproduces the bounded conjunction one level down.

Every primitive below is of the first kind. That is the content of the probe: `fieldsCode` is
linear, so sums, scalar multiples and pointwise-bounded differences of packed numbers are
blockwise for free; equality of two in-range packings is blockwise by base uniqueness; and a
submask condition is blockwise by peeling one block at a time.

## The intended encoding

Per *register lane*, not per configuration: `Xpc, X₀, …, X_k`, each packing `n + 1` values.

**All lanes use the same outer base as the packed run**, `B = 2 ^ (w * (k + 1) + 1)`. This is
deliberately wasteful — a lane block spends `w * (k + 1) + 1` bits carrying a `w`-bit value —
and it is what keeps the connection to #47's `R` a single global identity,

```
R = Xpc + 2 ^ w * X₀ + 2 ^ (2 * w) * X₁ + ⋯
```

blockwise, since a configuration code is below `2 ^ (w * (k + 1))` and so below `B`. Lanes at
their own tight base `2 ^ (w + 1)` would have forced a second packed-run development alongside
#47 and #48; at base `B` those two are reused unchanged.

The data mask for a lane is `M = (2 ^ w - 1) * geom B (n + 1)`: one `w`-bit field per block,
guard bits clear.

For a fixed program of `m` instructions, selectors `S₀, …, S_{m-1}` pack `n` bits, and each
`dec` selector splits as `S⁺ₚ + S⁰ₚ`. The conditions are then, all global:

* `IsBinarySubmask Sₚ (geom B n)` — each selector is one bit per block;
* `∑ₚ Sₚ = geom B n` — exactly one instruction runs per step, carry-free because
  `P.length < 2 ^ w` is part of `Aggregation`'s bundle;
* `Xpc % Bⁿ = ∑ₚ p · Sₚ` — the selector agrees with the program counter;
* `Xpc / B = ∑ₚ targetₚ · Sₚ^branch` — the jump;
* `X_r / B + ∑_{dec r} S⁺ₚ = X_r % Bⁿ + ∑_{inc r} Sₚ` — the register update, subtraction-free;
* for each instruction, the bound on the target it *selects*:
  `Sₚ = 0 ∨ jₚ < 2 ^ w` for an `inc`, and `S⁺ₚ = 0 ∨ jposₚ < 2 ^ w`,
  `S⁰ₚ = 0 ∨ jzeroₚ < 2 ^ w` for a `dec`;
* for each `dec` instruction `p` reading register `r`:
  `S⁰ₚ + S⁺ₚ = Sₚ`, both submasked by `geom B n`;
  `IsBinarySubmask (S⁰ₚ · (2 ^ w - 1)) (M % Bⁿ - X_r % Bⁿ)` — the zero branch;
  `X_r % Bⁿ = X''ₚ + S⁺ₚ` **together with** `IsBinarySubmask X''ₚ (M % Bⁿ)` — the positive
  branch.

That last mask is load-bearing, not decoration. Without it the equation is unsound blockwise,
because the addition may carry: at `B = 8`, `X = 8`, `S⁺ = 1`, `X'' = 7` satisfies `X = X'' + S⁺`
while block `0` of `X` is zero and block `0` of `S⁺` is one. Bounding each block of `X''` below
`2 ^ w` rules the carry out.

The selected-target bounds are load-bearing for the same reason, one level up.
`P.length < 2 ^ w` bounds instruction *indices*, but a `Program` may carry jump targets far
larger than either `P.length` or `2 ^ w`, and `targetₚ · Sₚ` is blockwise only while
`targetₚ < B`. Without them a large target carries between selector blocks and the jump equation
can be satisfied spuriously. They are stated per branch, and as disjunctions, because
`EncodedStep` bounds only the target it selects: requiring every target in the program to fit
would be strictly stronger, and wrong, since an unreachable branch need not fit. Because a
target is a *constant*, the bounded universal `∀ i < n, sₚ,ᵢ = 1 → jₚ < 2 ^ w` collapses to the
disjunction `Sₚ = 0 ∨ jₚ < 2 ^ w`, which is one `ExpDioph.or`.

Several instructions may read the same register: give each `dec` its own `S⁰ₚ` and `S⁺ₚ`, and the
global selector partition puts their conditions on disjoint blocks.

## Status

The primitives are proved. The **acceptance slice** is **not built**, and until it is, the
encoding above is an argument rather than a theorem. This file discharges nothing of
`Aggregation`.

The slice must exercise four cases: `n = 0`; an increment; both branches of a decrement; and an
*unselected* branch whose target exceeds `2 ^ w`, confirming that the encoding does not
accidentally demand that every target fit. A second decrement reading the same register belongs
in a separate regression rather than the minimal slice.

A lane's blocks hold `w`-bit values inside `w * (k + 1) + 1`-bit blocks, so the lane data mask is
*narrower* than `BlockPacking`'s `guardMask` and is not an instance of it. These two lemmas are
the ones the globalisation step demands: the mask is a constant packing, and it characterises
both the range and the per-block bound. -/
