# Register machines

Issue #19: the smallest machine model that can be arithmetised. A program is a list of
instructions over `Fin k` registers; a configuration is a program counter together with a
register file.

Mathlib has no register, Minsky or FRACTRAN machine at the pinned revision — `TMToPartrec` and
the `Turing.TM*` files are tape-flavoured, which is the wrong shape here. The point of this
model is that a configuration is a *number*, and tapes are not.

## Design

Three decisions, each made to keep #20 and #21 cheap, since every feature here is paid for twice.

**No `halt` instruction.** A configuration is halted exactly when its program counter is out of
range. This makes list concatenation the sequential-composition operator: a machine "exits" by
jumping to `P.length`, and in `P ++ Q` that same jump is `Q`'s entry point. An explicit `halt`
would need a separate rule for what concatenation does to it.

**Every instruction carries its jump targets**, including `inc`, which could have fallen through
to `pc + 1`. Uniform shape means relocating a program is a single map over targets rather than a
case split, which is what #39 consumes.

**No configuration encoding here.** The acceptance criteria originally asked for the encoded
configuration and its step lemma; that obligation now lives in #45, where the base and guard-bit
width are chosen together with the run packing they have to fit.

## Main definitions

* `RegisterMachine.Instr`, `Program`, `Config`
* `RegisterMachine.step`, `run`, `Halted`, `Halts`

## A smoke test

The decrement loop of the route spike (#15), as a one-register, one-instruction machine. It
exercises the only nonstandard choice in the model — that halting is a program counter out of
range rather than an instruction — and confirms that a `dec` whose zero-branch jumps to
`P.length` does in fact stop.
