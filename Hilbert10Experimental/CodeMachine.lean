# Every code has a machine

Issue #44. The constructor library is complete, so this is a structural induction that selects
the right closure theorem in each case.

## Proposition-valued on purpose

`exists_cleanMachine` is an existential, not a `Code → Program` compiler with a correctness
certificate. Nothing downstream needs the machine as *data*: #21 arithmetises a fixed machine's
trace relation, and fixing it is existential elimination in a `Prop`. Producing a dependent
compiler object would be the verified-DSL project (#29) arriving through the side door — the same
argument that made DPRM a semantic theorem in the first place.

## The graph relation

`Accepts` (in `CleanScratch`) is trace-level: it says the machine takes the clean configuration
for `x` to the clean configuration for `y`, with no mention of the function computed.
`accepts_iff` is the only place the two meet, and `exists_machine_graph` is what #21 consumes.
