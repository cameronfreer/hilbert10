# DPRM on `ℕ`: the machine route's endpoint

Issue #23, first part. Two facts are already available and this file only joins them:

* `exists_machine_graph` (#20) compiles a `Nat.Partrec.Code` into a register machine whose
  accepted relation is the graph of `c.eval`;
* `dioph_accepts_regs` (#21, #49) says acceptance by an arbitrary register machine is
  Diophantine.

Composing them gives the graph of any partial recursive function, and projecting the output
gives its domain. A recursively enumerable predicate on `ℕ` is the domain of such a function,
which is the unary case of DPRM.

## Where the register count goes

`exists_machine_graph` produces a machine on `k + 1` registers, and `dioph_accepts_regs` is
stated for `Program (k + 1)`, so the two fit with no side condition: there is no `Aggregation 0`
to discharge, because a compiled machine always has at least one register.

## From `ℕ` to tuples

A machine consumes one number, while an `n`-ary predicate receives a `Fin n → ℕ`. The bridge is
`TupleCoding`, used in both directions: its decoder is computable, which carries a recursively
enumerable predicate on tuples to one on `ℕ`; its encoder's graph is Diophantine, which carries
the resulting condition back.

## The public statements

`REPred.dioph` and `dioph_iff_rePred` mention only `REPred` and `Dioph`. Nothing about register
machines, packed runs, selectors or `ExpDioph` appears in them, and the tuple coding is an
implementation detail of the proof rather than part of the interface.

## Main results

* `Nat.Partrec.graph_dioph`, `Nat.Partrec.dom_dioph`
* `REPred.dioph_nat` — the unary case
* `REPred.dioph`, `dioph_iff_rePred` — **DPRM**
