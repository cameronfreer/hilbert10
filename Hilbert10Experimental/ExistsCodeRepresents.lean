# Coding a polynomial that represents a relation

Issue #11, compatibility half: the one statement that needs `RepresentsNat` from #5, kept
in its own module so that `Hilbert10Experimental.ExistsCode` genuinely does not depend on
the `Poly`/`MvPolynomial` bridge — a fact about the import graph, not a claim in prose.
