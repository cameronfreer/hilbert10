# The exit contract

Issue #40. What a compiled program has to satisfy for #41 to be able to compose it.

A bare halting equivalence is too weak: `halts_append_of_exits` (#39) needs to know *where* a
program stops and *what* it leaves behind, not merely that it stops. So the contract is a single
predicate on runs:

```lean
Realises P F ↔ from every register file, `P` starts at 0, stays inside itself, exits at exactly
  `P.length`, and leaves the register file `F regs`
```

Two things follow from stating it this way rather than as a list of clauses.

*Output and preservation are one clause, not two.* `F` describes the whole final register file,
so a constructor's statement — say `fun regs => Function.update regs r 0` — says both what was
produced and that nothing else moved. There is no separate "owns these registers" side condition
to carry, and no way for the two halves to drift apart.

*It is exactly the hypothesis `halts_append_of_exits` wants.* `Realises.append` discharges that
lemma once and for all, so #41 composes machines without ever reasoning about program counters
again.

## Totality

`Realises` describes machines that always halt, which is what the constructors here are, and it
stays the right contract for total macros: register plumbing, and later the pairing arithmetic
of #51.

It is *not* enough for the compiler. `rfind'` is where divergence originates, but divergence
propagates: `comp cf cg` diverges wherever `cg` does, and so does `prec`, and so does `pair`. So
the recursive compilation already needs a partial contract at #41, not at #43. `PartRealises`
below is that companion, and `Realises.toPartRealises` embeds the total machines into it.

/-! ## The partial contract

`rfind'` is where divergence originates, but it propagates: `comp cf cg` diverges wherever `cg`
does, and so do `prec` and `pair`. So the recursive compilation needs this companion from #41
onward, and `Realises` remains the contract for total macros. -/

/-- `P` partially transforms the register file by `F`.

Both clauses are load-bearing. Every value of `F` is reached by an *exact* exit at `P.length`;
and conversely, whenever `P` halts at all, `F` is defined there.

The converse clause is what rules out halting by jumping past the end. Without it a machine
could satisfy the first clause vacuously on an input where `F` diverges and still stop, and
concatenating that machine would drop control into the middle of whatever follows. -/
