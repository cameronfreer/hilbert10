# The machine route, reduced to one obligation

Issue #49, first phase. #48 closed the semantic chain: `Accepts` is *equivalent* to the
existence of a packed run. This file represents every part of that statement except one, and
gives the remainder a name.

## What is discharged here

The endpoint of `accepts_iff_exists_encodedRun` has eight conjuncts under four existentials.
Seven of them are ordinary exponential Diophantine atoms:

* the two input and output bounds, `of_lt`;
* two endpoint equalities, `of_eq`, using the closed form `configCode w ⟨p, unaryConfig k x⟩
  = p + 2 ^ w * x`.

The rest — the program-length bound, the guard mask, and the bounded conjunction over indices —
is bundled into `Aggregation` and taken as a hypothesis, so that the accounting cannot drift:
`expDioph_accepts` is *conditional*, and the condition is a single `def` one can read.

## Why the bundle, and not the conjunct alone

The mask is not hard to represent. It is `ExpDioph.of_isBinarySubmask` (#34) applied to
`guardMask` with `geom` carried as a *variable* pinned by `geom_unique` — which is exactly what
that subtraction-free identity was proved for — and the program-length bound is one `of_lt`.
They are bundled anyway, because any construction that discharges the bounded conjunction needs
them as *hypotheses*: without the mask it must reason about arbitrary, possibly overflowing
block values, and without `P.length < 2 ^ w` it cannot bound instruction indices inside a block.
Stating the obligation as the weakest thing the endpoint actually needs is the same "prove only
the endpoint" rule the rest of the development follows. The geometric-sum witness therefore
stays internal to whatever proof discharges `Aggregation`.

## What is not discharged, and must not be faked

`Aggregation` is the same bounded-universal theorem the direct-route spike isolated in
`Spike/Sequences.lean`. Two things do not count as progress on it:

* adding a bounded-product or bounded-forall constructor to `ExpTerm` — that relocates the
  missing proof into new syntax;
* `boundedForall_eq_iff_prod`. Product-equals-one is *equivalent* to the bounded universal for
  those gap factors, so the reduction is free and the representation of the variable product is
  the whole of the difficulty.

Any discharge must come from an independently proved representation theorem, and attribution
belongs at the deepest non-circular one.

## Main definitions

* `RegisterMachine.blockTerm` — outer block lookup at a **variable** index
* `RegisterMachine.Aggregation` — the sole remaining obligation

## Main results

* `RegisterMachine.expDioph_accepts` — conditional on `Aggregation`

/-! ### Terms for the outer layer

`ConfigCodingDioph`'s `fieldTerm` reads a field at a numeral index, which is right for the
inner layer: the program is fixed, so its register indices are numerals. The outer index runs
over blocks and is a variable, so it needs its own term. -/

/-! ### The obligation -/

/-- **The obligation for one program**: a bounded conjunction of step relations over a variable
number of block indices, bundled with the two facts any proof of it would have to assume anyway.

Stated with `N`, `W`, `R` as terms and the index quantified semantically, so that it cannot be
satisfied by making the index a numeral or by assuming a representable lookup function.

Separated from `Aggregation` because it is provable for particular programs — see
`Spike/SelectorSliceDioph` — long before it is provable for all of them, and the endpoint below
only ever needs it at the one program it is applied to. -/

program. -/

packed run. There is no fourth witness — the geometric sum moved inside `Aggregation`. -/
