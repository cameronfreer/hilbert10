# Guarded block packing

The reusable layer extracted from the route spike (#15): a block layout with one guard bit
per block, and the two APIs its two consumers actually need.

## Two APIs, deliberately

The spike proved both directions of a machine encoding against this layer, and they consume
it differently:

* **soundness** uses the global characterisation `isBinarySubmask_guardMask_iff`, which turns
  a mask hypothesis into every block bound plus `R < blockBase k ^ t`;
* **completeness** uses the recursive split `isBinarySubmask_split` together with
  `guardMask_succ`, peeling one block from each side in step.

Both are exported. Factoring against only one consumer would have picked the wrong API.

The layout is fixed at **one guard bit**: data values below `2 ^ k`, blocks of width `k + 1`.
That is the construction the spike validated, and it is the right reusable unit; block layouts
with more guard bits or non-uniform fields are not generalised over here.

`geom` is not new API — it is `∑ i ∈ Finset.range t, b ^ i`, mathlib's geometric sum, given a
local name for readability. What is worth keeping is `geom_unique`, the subtraction-free
uniqueness statement, which is stated against that sum.
