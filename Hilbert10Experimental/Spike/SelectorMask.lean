# Route probe: can selector masks aggregate a run without a bounded universal?

Time-boxed probe for #49, phase 2. `Aggregation` is a bounded conjunction over block indices,
bundled with a guard mask and a program-length bound. The question is whether, for a *fixed*
program, it can instead be expressed by finitely many global identities.

## The distinction that decides it

A condition on a packed number is acceptable if the equivalence

> global identity between numbers  ⟺  the same identity in every block

is a **theorem proved by induction on the block index**, and unacceptable if it is a
*Diophantine condition* that itself needs representing. The circularity trap in
`Spike/Sequences.lean` is the second kind: coding partial products and requiring
`p (i + 1) = p i * h i` reproduces the bounded conjunction one level down.

Every primitive below is of the first kind. That is the content of the probe: `fieldsCode` is
linear, so sums, scalar multiples and pointwise-bounded differences of packed numbers are
blockwise for free; equality of two in-range packings is blockwise by base uniqueness; and a
submask condition is blockwise by peeling one block at a time.

## The intended encoding

Per *register lane*, not per configuration: `Xpc, X₀, …, X_k`, each packing `n + 1` values.

**All lanes use the same outer base as the packed run**, `B = 2 ^ (w * (k + 1) + 1)`. This is
deliberately wasteful — a lane block spends `w * (k + 1) + 1` bits carrying a `w`-bit value —
and it is what keeps the connection to #47's `R` a single global identity,

```
R = Xpc + 2 ^ w * X₀ + 2 ^ (2 * w) * X₁ + ⋯
```

blockwise, since a configuration code is below `2 ^ (w * (k + 1))` and so below `B`. Lanes at
their own tight base `2 ^ (w + 1)` would have forced a second packed-run development alongside
#47 and #48; at base `B` those two are reused unchanged.

The data mask for a lane is `M = (2 ^ w - 1) * geom B (n + 1)`: one `w`-bit field per block,
guard bits clear.

For a fixed program of `m` instructions, selectors `S₀, …, S_{m-1}` pack `n` bits, and each
`dec` selector splits as `S⁺ₚ + S⁰ₚ`. The conditions are then, all global:

* `IsBinarySubmask Sₚ (geom B n)` — each selector is one bit per block;
* `∑ₚ Sₚ = geom B n` — exactly one instruction runs per step, carry-free because
  `P.length < 2 ^ w` is part of `Aggregation`'s bundle;
* `Xpc % Bⁿ = ∑ₚ p · Sₚ` — the selector agrees with the program counter;
* `Xpc / B = ∑ₚ targetₚ · Sₚ^branch` — the jump;
* `X_r / B + ∑_{dec r} S⁺ₚ = X_r % Bⁿ + ∑_{inc r} Sₚ` — the register update, subtraction-free;
* for each instruction, the bound on the target it *selects*:
  `Sₚ = 0 ∨ jₚ < 2 ^ w` for an `inc`, and `S⁺ₚ = 0 ∨ jposₚ < 2 ^ w`,
  `S⁰ₚ = 0 ∨ jzeroₚ < 2 ^ w` for a `dec`;
* for each `dec` instruction `p` reading register `r`:
  `S⁰ₚ + S⁺ₚ = Sₚ`, both submasked by `geom B n`;
  `IsBinarySubmask (S⁰ₚ · (2 ^ w - 1)) (M % Bⁿ - X_r % Bⁿ)` — the zero branch;
  `X_r % Bⁿ = X''ₚ + S⁺ₚ` **together with** `IsBinarySubmask X''ₚ (M % Bⁿ)` — the positive
  branch.

That last mask is load-bearing, not decoration. Without it the equation is unsound blockwise,
because the addition may carry: at `B = 8`, `X = 8`, `S⁺ = 1`, `X'' = 7` satisfies `X = X'' + S⁺`
while block `0` of `X` is zero and block `0` of `S⁺` is one. Bounding each block of `X''` below
`2 ^ w` rules the carry out.

The selected-target bounds are load-bearing for the same reason, one level up.
`P.length < 2 ^ w` bounds instruction *indices*, but a `Program` may carry jump targets far
larger than either `P.length` or `2 ^ w`, and `targetₚ · Sₚ` is blockwise only while
`targetₚ < B`. Without them a large target carries between selector blocks and the jump equation
can be satisfied spuriously. They are stated per branch, and as disjunctions, because
`EncodedStep` bounds only the target it selects: requiring every target in the program to fit
would be strictly stronger, and wrong, since an unreachable branch need not fit. Because a
target is a *constant*, the bounded universal `∀ i < n, sₚ,ᵢ = 1 → jₚ < 2 ^ w` collapses to the
disjunction `Sₚ = 0 ∨ jₚ < 2 ^ w`, which is one `ExpDioph.or`.

Several instructions may read the same register: give each `dec` its own `S⁰ₚ` and `S⁺ₚ`, and the
global selector partition puts their conditions on disjoint blocks.

## Status

The primitives are proved. The **acceptance slice** is **not built**, and until it is, the
encoding above is an argument rather than a theorem. This file discharges nothing of
`Aggregation`.

The slice must exercise four cases: `n = 0`; an increment; both branches of a decrement; and an
*unselected* branch whose target exceeds `2 ^ w`, confirming that the encoding does not
accidentally demand that every target fit. A second decrement reading the same register belongs
in a separate regression rather than the minimal slice.

This is the mechanism behind the disjunctions `Sₚ = 0 ∨ targetₚ < 2 ^ w` in the condition list.
It is what stops an oversized target on an unreachable branch from being required to fit, and it
is why the bound must be stated per branch rather than over the whole program. -/
