# Hilbert's tenth problem as a decision problem

Issue #13, the last piece of M2. This is the predicate whose undecidability is the
project's headline (#27), and whose RE-completeness is #35 and #26.

## The missing side condition

`HasNatRoot` places **no** constraint relating the length of the root to the arity:

```lean
def HasNatRoot (p : PolynomialCode) : Prop := ∃ x : List ℕ, p.eval x = 0
```

That is equivalent to demanding a root of length exactly `arity` (`hasNatRoot_iff`), because
zero-extension (#8) lets a short root be padded and the arity bound lets a long one be
truncated. The unconstrained form is what every later proof wants, since it never has to
produce or preserve a length invariant.

The name says `Nat` because the development is over natural-number assignments, matching
`Dioph`. Hilbert's original integer formulation is #28 and gets `IntSolvable`; nothing here
is called `H10` unqualified.

/-- A root may always be taken to have length exactly `arity`.

The witness is uniform in both directions: pad with zeros and truncate to `arity`, which is
correct whether the original root was short or long, so no case split on lengths is
needed. -/
