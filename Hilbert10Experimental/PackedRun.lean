# A whole run as one number

Issue #47: packed-run completeness, semantically. An accepting run becomes a single natural
number whose blocks are the configuration codes of its successive configurations.

## Two nestings of the same construction

`fieldsCode` is used twice, at two widths, and that is the whole design.

*Inner*: a configuration of an `r`-register machine is `r + 1` fields of width `w`, so it
occupies `w * (r + 1)` bits (#45).

*Outer*: a run of `n + 1` configurations is `n + 1` blocks of width `w * (r + 1) + 1` — the
configuration, plus `BlockPacking`'s single guard bit. `Nat.IsBinarySubmask R (guardMask …)`
says exactly that every block's guard bit is clear, which by
`isBinarySubmask_guardMask_iff` is exactly that every block holds a configuration.

So extraction is `field_fieldsCode` at the outer width, and the mask obligation is the existing
`BlockPacking` characterisation. No new packing arithmetic appears here.

## Indexing

The width is written `w * (k + 1)` where `k` is the *program's* register count, so a
`Program (k + 1)` — which is what `CleanScratch` deals in — gets `w * (k + 2)` automatically.
The specialisation happens only at the `Accepts` endpoint.

## Scope

The bounded conjunction `∀ i < n, EncodedStep …` is left visible. Turning it into an exponential
Diophantine condition is #49; this file is semantics only.

## Main results

* `RegisterMachine.EncodedRun` — the packed-run predicate
* `RegisterMachine.encodedRun_packRun` — every prefix of a run packs
* `RegisterMachine.exists_encodedRun_of_accepts` — the endpoint #49 consumes

/-- **The endpoint #49 consumes.** An accepting run of `P` is a packed run from the clean input
configuration to the clean output configuration, *with the boundary constants bounded*.

The three bounds are not redundant with the mask. `EncodedRun` bounds its blocks, but an
oversized `x`, `y` or `P.length` carries inside `configCode` exactly as an oversized register
value carried inside `setField` before #45 was corrected, and the packed run would still satisfy
every block constraint. Stating them is what lets #48 recover the *exact* clean boundary
configurations rather than merely bounded ones. They are free at #46's width and cheap for
`ExpDioph`, being three `of_lt` conjuncts.

`Accepts` supplies exactly what `encodedRun_packRun` needs: the run length, the in-range program
counter at every transition, and the exit equation. Fitting comes from #46 internally and is
never an obligation on the caller. -/

/-! ### Soundness

The inverse of `encodedRun_packRun`. Every carry argument was discharged in #45, so this is an
induction over block indices and nothing else. -/

/-- **A packed run really is a run.** Generic in the boundary configurations; the clean
specialisation comes after.

The invariant is that block `i`, decoded, is the `i`-th configuration of the run. It is
maintained by `decodeConfig_step_of_encodedStep`, which needs only the block bound the mask
already supplies, and `n = 0` needs no separate case because the base case is the identification
of block `0`. -/
