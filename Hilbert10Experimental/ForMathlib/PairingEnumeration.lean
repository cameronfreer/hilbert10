# The pairing enumeration has a successor function

`Nat.pair` and `Nat.unpair` are stated with multiplication and `Nat.sqrt`. Taking those
definitions at face value would make a register-machine implementation a verified-arithmetic
project: a multiplier, a square root, and their correctness proofs.

But the pairing is an *enumeration* of `ℕ × ℕ`, and enumerations have successors. `pairNext` is
that successor, and the theorems below say it is correct:

```lean
Nat.pair (pairNext p).1 (pairNext p).2 = Nat.pair p.1 p.2 + 1
pairNext^[n] (0, 0) = Nat.unpair n
```

Neither statement mentions a square root, and neither proof needs one — `pairNext` is built from
comparison, increment and zeroing alone.

## Why this shape

The consumer is #51, which compiles `Nat.unpair` and `Nat.pair` into register machines.

`unpair n` becomes `pairNext` iterated `n` times from `(0, 0)`: a counted loop.

`pair a b` becomes the enumeration run until the state is `(a, b)`, counting steps.
`iterate_pairNext_pair` is what makes that terminate — after exactly `Nat.pair a b` steps the
state *is* `(a, b)` — so termination is proved directly rather than through a general unbounded
search, which would make #51 depend on the `rfind'` compiler it is supposed to precede.

Self-contained, and a plausible mathlib addition: nothing here depends on the rest of this
development. Tracked for upstreaming in #37.

## The enumeration

Values `s ^ 2 .. s ^ 2 + 2 * s` form the shell `max a b = s`: first `(a, s)` for `a < s`, then
`(s, b)` for `b ≤ s`. `pairNext` walks that, and rolls over from `(s, s)` to `(0, s + 1)`.
