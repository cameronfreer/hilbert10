# Every finite-arity polynomial has a code

Issue #11, core half. This module imports only #10, so its independence from the
`Poly`/`MvPolynomial` bridge is a fact about the Lean module graph and not merely a claim
in prose. The `RepresentsNat` corollary, which does need #5, lives in
`Hilbert10/ExistsCodeRepresents.lean`.

## The variable contract

Inputs are variables `0, …, n-1` and witnesses are variables `n, …, n+m-1`, contiguously
and in that order. That is exactly

```lean
Sum.elim (fun i : Fin n => i.val) (fun j : Fin m => n + j.val)
```

which is `varIndex` below. Every later milestone assumes this ordering, so it is stated
once, as a definition, and never re-derived.

## Implementation notes

The contract is an equality of *denotations*, not agreement of evaluations; the evaluation
corollary is derived from it via `eval_denote` and `MvPolynomial.eval_rename`.

Codes are built by induction on the polynomial with every exponent vector of length exactly
`n + m`. The fixed length is what makes multiplication by a variable well defined as
`List.set` at the variable's index: with ragged vectors `List.set` past the end is silently
a no-op, which would be a soundness bug rather than an inconvenience.

/-! ### The coding theorem -/

/-- Every polynomial in `n` input and `m` witness variables has a code, whose denotation is
literally the renaming of that polynomial along the variable contract.

The auxiliary conclusion — that every exponent vector has length exactly `n + m` — is what
makes the induction go through; `arity ≤ n + m` follows. -/
