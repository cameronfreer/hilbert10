# Compacting only the witness variables

Issue #2, staged here for upstreaming to mathlib.

`MvPolynomial.exists_fin_rename` reindexes the *entire* variable type along an injection
`Fin n → σ`. Applied at `σ = Fin n ⊕ β` it renumbers the input variables together with the
witnesses, which destroys the input/witness partition that the whole Hilbert-tenth
development is built on (issue #6 fixes inputs as the left summand and existential
witnesses as the right one).

What is needed instead is a *right-only* compaction: the `Fin n` block is fixed pointwise
and only `β` is compacted to its finite support.

/-- Compact only the right summand of the variable type: the variables from `σ` are preserved
pointwise, and the witnesses are reindexed by a finite injection.

Unlike `MvPolynomial.exists_fin_rename`, which reindexes the whole variable type along an
injection `Fin n → σ ⊕ β`, the left summand is left untouched. This is what the Diophantine
normal form needs: renumbering the *input* variables would change the relation represented.
