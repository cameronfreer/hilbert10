# Binary submasks

Generic bit-level material, extracted from the route spike (#15) once it became clear the
proofs are about an arbitrary power-of-two boundary rather than anything in the machine
encoding. Nothing here mentions a machine, a block layout, or a guard bit.

`Nat.IsBinarySubmask` is stated on `Nat.testBit`, which is the canonical form for this
project: #18 consumes it directly, and #34's contract is phrased in terms of it.

## Main results

* `Nat.isBinarySubmask_two_pow_sub_one_iff`: being a submask of `2 ^ k - 1` is fitting in
  `k` bits.
* `Nat.isBinarySubmask_add_mul_two_pow_iff`: a submask condition splits at a power-of-two
  boundary, provided the low part fits below it.
