# Integer solvability, and its equivalence with the natural version

Issue #28. `IntSolvable` is Hilbert's own question for the encoded wire format: does the coded
polynomial have an **integer** root? This file defines it and proves that it holds exactly when
the difference-substituted code has a natural root.

## Why the equivalence is stated on codes

`intSolvable_iff_natSolvable_subUV` is the mathematical content of the reduction
`IntSolvable ≤₀ NatSolvable`; what the reduction adds is that `subUV` is computable. Keeping the
two apart means the arithmetic can be checked without reading a computability proof, and the
computability proof does not have to re-establish any arithmetic.

## Both directions normalise first

The predicates quantify over arbitrary-length assignments, while the two-block reading needs a
fixed boundary at `p.arity`. Each direction therefore normalises its witness to an exact length
before splitting: integer witnesses through `exists_length_eq_arity_evalInt_eq`, natural ones
through the arity bound `arity_subUV_le` and zero-extension. Skipping that step would let a short
witness make `take` and `drop` describe the wrong blocks.

transformation; the equivalence above is its correctness. With

/-! ### Zero-arity regression

At `p.arity = 0` the frozen layout has no variables at all and the constraint list is empty, so the
transformation degenerates to `p²`. Both truth values are checked, since an off-by-one in the empty
`List.range` would make the equivalence vacuously true rather than visibly wrong. -/
