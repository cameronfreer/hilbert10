# From a representation to a reduction

Issue #35, the computational centrepiece — and the whole scope argument of the project in
one theorem. A relation with *any* polynomial representation many-one reduces to
`NatSolvable`, with **no DPRM content whatsoever**.

## Why the nonuniformity is fine

The target `R ≤₀ NatSolvable` is a proposition, so existential elimination may fix the
representing polynomial locally. **No uniform data-valued extractor is produced**: there is
deliberately no function from representations to codes here, and in particular nothing of
the shape `Nat.Partrec.Code → PolynomialCode` (see #29).

The reduction is `fun x => q.instantiate (List.ofFn x)`. It is computable in `x` because `q`
is a *constant* — chosen once, outside the reduction — and only `instantiate` has to be
computable. Note that fixing `q` needs no choice principle at all: eliminating an
existential into a `Prop` is constructive.

## Test rather than argument

The final example compiles a hand-written representation of "is a sum of two squares" all
the way to a many-one reduction, exercising #5, #10, #11, #12 and #13 end to end before any
of M4's cost is incurred.

/-! ### End-to-end test

A hand-written representation, compiled to a reduction. This exercises the whole M1–M2
pipeline — `RepresentsNat`, `exists_code`, `denote`, `instantiate`, `NatSolvable` — with no
DPRM content, which is the point of doing it now rather than after M4.
