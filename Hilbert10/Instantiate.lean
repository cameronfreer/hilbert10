# Specializing the initial variables of a code

Issue #12. This is the only substitution-like operation the project ships, and it is
simultaneously the computable step in the nonuniform-specialisation reduction (#35) and the
partial-evaluation primitive a future compiler would want.

## Design

A term is specialized by *evaluating its own initial segment*:

```lean
specializeTerm params t =
  (eval ⟨[(t.1, t.2.take params.length)]⟩ params, t.2.drop params.length)
```

The new coefficient is the old one with the parameter powers folded in, computed by reusing
`eval` itself, so no integer multiplication lemma is needed beyond what #9 already proved.
The variable shift is exactly `List.drop params.length`, term count and order are preserved,
and the encoding stays permissive.

`eval_instantiate` holds unconditionally — in particular for parameter lists longer than a
term's exponent vector, where the vector is entirely consumed and `drop` leaves nothing.
That is a consequence of the zero-extension convention from #8, not an extra hypothesis.

/-! ### Evaluation -/

/-- Splitting an assignment splits a monomial's value: the exponents consumed by `params`
contribute a factor computed from `params` alone. Holds for every `e` and `params`, with no
length hypothesis — if `e` is shorter than `params` the second factor is `1`. -/

/-- Instantiating and then evaluating is evaluating at the concatenated assignment. No
length hypotheses: the zero-extension convention of #8 makes this hold for every list. -/

/-! ### Sanity checks

`x₀ ^ 2 + x₁ ^ 2 - 25` specialized at `x₀ := 3` becomes `9 + x₀ ^ 2 - 25`: the term count
and order are preserved, the first term collapses to a constant, and the surviving variable
has shifted down by one. The second example supplies more parameters than the polynomial has
variables, which is legal and leaves nothing.
