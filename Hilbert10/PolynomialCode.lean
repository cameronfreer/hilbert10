# A wire format for Hilbert's tenth problem

Issue #8. To state H10 as a decision problem the input must be a finitely encoded object;
this is that encoding, and deliberately nothing more.

## Design

* **Permissive, not canonical.** Duplicate monomials, zero coefficients, trailing zero
  exponents and arbitrary term order are all legal. H10's undecidability must not depend
  on canonicalisation, so there is no quotient, no normal form and no `DecidableEq`
  obligation.
* **Missing variables evaluate to zero.** Evaluation recurses structurally over the
  exponent and assignment lists in parallel; an exhausted assignment is treated as zeros.
  This is what makes zero-extension hold *unconditionally* and keeps the computability
  proof of #9 free of index arithmetic.
* **`arity` is a presentation upper bound**, the maximum exponent-vector length — not the
  minimal semantic arity, which would be false for a permissive format. Every use of it in
  this project is an upper bound. Do not state or rely on any minimality lemma.

Deliberately absent: any `MvPolynomial` connection (that is #10), any `+`/`*` API,
substitution beyond #12, systems of equations, or fresh-variable allocation.

/-! ### Zero-extension

Padding an assignment with zeros never changes a value, with no hypothesis at all: the
variables being supplied were already being read as zero.

/-! ### Append-invariance under the arity bound

Once an assignment is at least as long as the arity, appending anything is invisible: the
extra values are never read.

/-! ### Sanity checks

Concrete instances of the three conventions, kept as regression tests: the encoding of
`x₀ ^ 2 + x₁ ^ 2 - 25`, a variable read past the end of an assignment, and a trailing zero
exponent inflating `arity` without changing any value.
