# Computability closure used before DPRM

Generic facts about recursively enumerable predicates that this development needs *below* the
DPRM theorem. Nothing here mentions `Dioph`, and nothing here may depend on `REPred.dioph`.

## Why this is its own module

The import direction is the point:

```
Computability  →  DPRM  →  DerivedDioph  →  endpoints and examples
```

`REPred.of_manyOneReducible` is convenient enough to be reached for anywhere, and one of the
places it must *not* be reached for is inside the DPRM proof, where "recursive enumerability
transfers along a computable map" is close enough to the theorem being proved to invite a circle.
Keeping it here, below `DPRM`, makes the permitted direction visible in the import graph rather
than in a comment. The post-DPRM consequences live in `DerivedDioph`, above it.

Its two consumers are the integer formulation (`rePred_intSolvable`) and that derived layer.

## Main results
